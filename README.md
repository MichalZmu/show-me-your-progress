# Reserve your beach seat

This project was created to demonstrate a simpe task manager. The application was written in TypeScript with Angular 11. All the reservations are stored in the cloud database (MongoDB) and managed by NGRX state management. For communications between database and application, I created REST API (Node.js with Express and Mongoose). For the graphic layer, I used Angular Material.

## How it works

It's very simple, you can add, edit and delte tasks. What is more, you can set you task goal for today and control if you reached it or not. The mechanism counts all tasks that have been closed today.

## Getting started

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. I use NPM to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. Run npm install to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
